    <p>I am a final-year master's student in Computer Software Engineering at the University of Tehran with a perfect 4.0/4.0 GPA, specializing in conversational AI and speech processing. My thesis research, guided by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E-QpN74AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Shakery</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=m5tCFEoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Faili</a>, focuses on developing zero-shot text-to-speech models for the Persian language. I have curated a comprehensive multispeaker Persian dataset comprising over 5K hours of audiobooks and podcasts, and developed advanced TTS models specifically optimized for Persian.</p>
    
    <p>As a Research and Teaching Assistant at the University of Tehran's NLP Lab and Intelligent Information Systems Lab, I lead research on Persian speech synthesis and medical language models. I have designed comprehensive assignments for Machine Learning Methods in NLP and Digital Speech Processing courses, serving over 200+ students across multiple courses. Additionally, I co-founded <a href="https://sofiamind.ir/" target="_blank">SOFIA</a>, where I architected and deployed a multi-platform RAG-based customer service chatbot that has achieved 20,000+ active users on University of Tehran's website.</p>
    
    <p>Before my graduate studies, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://ee.aut.ac.ir/" target="_blank">Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)</a>, where I worked on facial expression recognition with robotic implementation under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EN-JbQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Menhaj</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4hByEOYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Taheri</a>. I have consistently demonstrated academic excellence, ranking in the top 0.5% in national entrance exams.</p>
