Before joining the NLP lab, I received my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), where I worked as a research assistant at the Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab on facial expression recognition under the mentorship of [Dr. Menhaj](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Menhaj's_Google_Scholar_ID) and [Dr. Taheri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Taheri's_Google_Scholar_ID).

Currently, I'm deeply committed to both teaching and research roles. I serve as a teaching assistant for Machine Learning at Sharif University of Technology and Deep Learning at the University of Tehran. Additionally, I am actively involved in the development of a retrieval-augmented chatbot named SOFIA.
