Hello! I am Mohammad Javad Ranjbar, an enthusiastic and innovative electrical and computer engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran under the guidance of Dr. Faili and Dr. Shakeri. I am an active member of the Natural Language Processing Lab, and I am interested in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and speech synthesis.<br />

My academic journey began with a BSc in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), where I delved into facial expression recognition under the mentorship of Dr. Menhaj and Dr. Taheri. My enthusiasm for research led me to serve as a research assistant at the Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab at AUT, as well as a teaching assistant for the Introduction to Computational Intelligence Course.<br />

Currently, I'm dedicated to both teaching and research, serving as a teaching assistant for Machine Learning at the Sharif University of Technology and Deep Learning at the University of Tehran. My research goal is focused on few-shot text-to-speech synthesis.
