I am a highly motivated and creative electrical and computer engineer currently pursuing a master's degree in computer engineering at the University of Tehran. My research interests encompass Deep Learning and Machine Learning, with a particular focus on Natural Language Processing, Speech Synthesis, and Computer Vision.<br />

My academic journey began with a BSc in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), where I delved into facial expression recognition under the mentorship of Dr. Menhaj and Dr. Taheri. My enthusiasm for research led me to serve as a research assistant at the Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab at AUT, as well as a teaching assistant for the Introduction to Computational Intelligence Course. I am proud to have contributed to academia with the publication of a paper based on my BSc thesis, titled "Social Robots: An Open-Source Framework for Personal Assistant Robots," which was featured in the Proceedings of the 10th RSI International Conference on Robotics and Mechatronics (ICRoM 2022). <br />

Currently, I'm dedicated to both teaching and research, serving as a teaching assistant for Machine Learning and Statistical Inference at the University of Tehran, and actively contributing to the field of Natural Language Processing under the guidance of Dr. Faili and Dr. Shakeri. Currently, my focus lies in the development of my master's thesis, which explores audio models and their application in voice cloning.
