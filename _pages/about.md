I am a motivated and creative electrical and computer engineer, studying master's in computer engineering at the University of Tehran. Currently, my main research interests are Computer Vision, Data Mining, and Machine Learning. I am also interested in research in Natural Language Processing, Cognitive neuroscience, Reinforcement Learning, etc.<br />
Previously, I got my BSc in electrical engineering from Amirkabir university of technology (AUT). During my studies, I have worked under the supervision of Dr. Menhaj and Dr. Taheri on My Bsc thesis which was about facial expression recognition. I used transfer learning to finetune ResNet for the facial expression recognition task. then, I implemented the facial expression recognition system on a personal assistant robot that knows its owners and people can command them to play a song. The robot will interact with them based on their facial expressions by playing the proper song or showing emotions with gestures. I have also made a data mining app to find the emotion in videos and their duration. <br />
I am really passionate about my field of research, I have been a research assistant at Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab at Amirkabir University of Technology and I also have been a teaching assistant for the Introduction to Computational Intelligence Course at Amirkabir University.
