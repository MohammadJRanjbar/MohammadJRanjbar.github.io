I have recently graduated as an electrical engineer from Amirkabir university of technology (AUT) Tehran polytechnic. My research interest is to build intelligent models, which understands usersâ€™ status clearly and provide people with better services, by utilizing methods in Machine Learning, Deep Learning Computer Vision, Data Mining and Natural Language Processing techniques. My BSc thesis was about Facial Expression Recognition and I implemented it under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Bagher Menhaj and Dr. Hassan Taheri. I used transfer learning to finetune ResNet for the facial expression recognition task. then, I implemented the facial expression recognition system on a personal assistant robot that knows its owners and people can command them to play a song. The robot will interact with them based on their facial expressions by playing the proper song or showing emotions with gestures. I have also made a data mining app to find the emotion in videos and their duration.
