I have recently graduated as an electrical engineer from Amirkabir university of technology (AUT) Tehran polytechnic. My research interest is to build intelligent applications, which model data for understanding usersâ€™ status clearly and provide people with better services, by utilizing methods in natural language processing, Computer Vision, Data Mining and machine learning techniques. My BSc thesis was about Facial Expression Recognition and I implemented it under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Bagher Menhaj and Dr. Hassan Taheri. I used transfer learning to finetune ResNet for the facial expression recognition task. then, I implemented the facial expression recognition system on a personal assistant robot that knows its owners and based on the facial expression of them interacts with them by playing the proper song or showing emotions with gestures and more.
