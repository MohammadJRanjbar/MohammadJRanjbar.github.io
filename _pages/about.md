I'm a motivated and creative electrical and computer engineer, pursuing a master's in computer engineering at the University of Tehran. My research passions span Computer Vision, Data Mining, and Machine Learning, with a keen interest in Natural Language Processing, Cognitive Neuroscience, and Reinforcement Learning.<br />

My academic journey began with a BSc in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), where I delved into facial expression recognition under the mentorship of Dr. Menhaj and Dr. Taheri. My enthusiasm for research led me to serve as a research assistant at the Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab at AUT, as well as a teaching assistant for the Introduction to Computational Intelligence Course.<br />

Currently, I'm dedicated to both teaching and research, serving as a teaching assistant for Machine Learning and Statistical Inference at the University of Tehran, and actively contributing to the field of Natural Language Processing under the guidance of Dr. Faili and Dr. Shakeri.
