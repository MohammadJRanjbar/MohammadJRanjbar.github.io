<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>I am a final-year master's student in Computer Software Engineering at the University of Tehran, specializing in developing text-to-speech models. My research, guided by <a href="https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=m5tCFEoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Faili</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E-QpN74AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Shakery</a>, focuses on creating a zero-shot text-to-speech model for the Persian language. Additionally, I contribute to the Natural Language Processing Lab, where I am involved in various projects including <a href="https://sofiamind.ir/" target="_blank">SOFIA</a>, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based chatbot designed for customer service.</p>

    <p>Before joining the University of Tehran, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://ee.aut.ac.ir/" target="_blank">Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant in the Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab, focusing on facial expression recognition under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EN-JbQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Menhaj</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4hByEOYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Taheri</a>.</p>
