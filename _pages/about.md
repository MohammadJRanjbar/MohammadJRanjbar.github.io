I have recently graduated as electrical engineer from Amirkabir university of technology (AUT) Tehran polytechnic. My research interest is to build intelligent applications, which model data for understanding usersâ€™ status clearly and provide people with better services, by utilizing methods in natural language processing, Computer Vision, Data Mining and machine learning techniques. I currently work with Dr. Menhaj and Dr. Taheri on My Bsc thesis which is about recognizing human facial expressions with machine learning.
