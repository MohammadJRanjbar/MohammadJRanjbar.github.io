<div style="text-align: justify;">

I am a final-year master's student in Computer Software Engineering at University of Tehran, specializing in the development of text-to-speech models. My current research, under the guidance of [Dr. Faili](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=m5tCFEoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Shakery](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E-QpN74AAAAJ&hl=en), focuses on creating a zero-shot text-to-speech model for Persian language. Additionally, I contribute to the Natural Language Processing Lab, where I am involved in various projects such as [SOFIA](https://sofiamind.ir/), a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based chatbot designed for customer service.

Prior to my studies at the University of Tehran, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)](https://ee.aut.ac.ir/). During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research assistant in the Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab, focusing on facial expression recognition under the mentorship of [Dr. Menhaj](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EN-JbQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Taheri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4hByEOYAAAAJ&hl=en).
