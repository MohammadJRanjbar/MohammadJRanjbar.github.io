### Education

Hello! I am Mohammad Javad Ranjbar, an enthusiastic and innovative Electrical and Computer Engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran under the guidance of [Dr. Faili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Faili's_Google_Scholar_ID) and [Dr. Shakeri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Shakeri's_Google_Scholar_ID). I am an active member of the Natural Language Processing Lab, where my research is focused on few-shot text-to-speech synthesis.

Before joining the NLP lab, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT). During my time there, I worked as a research assistant at the Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab on facial expression recognition under the mentorship of [Dr. Menhaj](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Menhaj's_Google_Scholar_ID) and [Dr. Taheri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Taheri's_Google_Scholar_ID).

### Research & Interests

I'm deeply committed to both teaching and research roles. Currently, I serve as a teaching assistant for Machine Learning at Sharif University of Technology and Deep Learning at the University of Tehran. My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and speech synthesis. 

In addition to my academic roles, I am actively involved in the development of a retrieval-augmented chatbot named SOFIA, which aims to enhance conversational AI experiences.
