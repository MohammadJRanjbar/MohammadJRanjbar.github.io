Hello! I am Mohammad Javad Ranjbar, an enthusiastic and innovative Electrical and Computer Engineer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran under the guidance of [Dr. Faili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Faili's_Google_Scholar_ID) and [Dr. Shakeri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Shakeri's_Google_Scholar_ID). I am an active member of the Natural Language Processing Lab, and I am interested in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and speech synthesis. My research goal is focused on few-shot text-to-speech synthesis. <br />

Before joining the NLP lab, I received my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), where I worked as a research assistant at the Intelligence and Large Scale System Research Lab on facial expression recognition under the mentorship of [Dr. Menhaj](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Menhaj's_Google_Scholar_ID) and [Dr. Taheri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Taheri's_Google_Scholar_ID). <br />

Currently, I'm deeply committed to both teaching and research roles. I serve as a teaching assistant for Machine Learning at Sharif University of Technology and Deep Learning at the University of Tehran. Additionally, I am actively involved in the development of a retrieval-augmented chatbot named SOFIA.
