excerpt: 'Implementing DLS.'

First, I made a RubikCube Class therfore user will be able to play the game. Second, I implemented a graph
class based on Depth-limited search (DLS) method that gets the Depth number and returns if the Rubik is
solvable or not and if it is solvable it returns the needed moves to solve the Rubik.
