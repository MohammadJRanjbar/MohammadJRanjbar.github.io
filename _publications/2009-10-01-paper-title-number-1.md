excerpt: 'Controlling the snake game with voice, Motion and hand gesture.'

I implemented the game with the help of the Pygame module, for the Voice control I trained a model with the 4 wake word, for motion control I detected the movement of a specific colour and for the gesture recognition I trained a CNN model with 4 gestures.
